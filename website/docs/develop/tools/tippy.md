Tippy is a tool to help set up and manage CKB nodes, enabling the installation and launching of a CKB node with a simple click.

The CKB nodes used in the DApp development are **full nodes** that are the verifiers of the CKB network. A CKB full node verifies new blocks and transactions, relays blocks and transactions, and selects the chain fork on which it agrees.
