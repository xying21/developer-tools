## Overview

CKB SDK is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote CKB node by using JSON-RPC. CKB SDK encapsulates cryptographic algorithms and RPC services to support the development of applications on CKB. The knowledge of CKB Data Model (see [Nervos CKB Reference](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/introduction) and [CKB RFC: CKB Data Structures](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0019-data-structures/0019-data-structures.md)) and [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/tree/develop/rpc) are crucial in developing applications by using this SDK.

Now CKB SDK is implemented by the following programming languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go and Rust.

* [ckb-sdk-js](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-js)

* [ckb-sdk-java](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-java)

* [ckb-sdk-go](https://github.com/ququzone/ckb-sdk-go)

* [ckb-sdk-rust](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-rust)
