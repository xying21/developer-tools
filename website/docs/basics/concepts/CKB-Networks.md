A CKB node can be set up to connect and interact with one of the following CKB networks:

- **Mainnet (Mirana)**: Mainnet is the main CKB public network. The real-time information of the Lina Mainnet can be checked on the [CKB Explorer](https://explorer.nervos.org/) page.

- **Testnet (Pudge)**: Testnet is used to test applications integration and smart contracts in real environment with actual data.

  For the first time to run a node on the **Testnet**, syncing data requires upwards of one hour depending on your network connection. The real-time block number on the Testnet can be checked on the [CKB Explorer](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/) page.<br/>

- **DEV Chain**:  DEV chain is a local blockchain that provides an efficient and useful development mode for building and testing applications.
